    "## 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usefullness: \n",
    "Functions allows to break the problem into small bits and modules which makes the problem organized,easier to decode. The code can be used for the similar problem statement which also saves time.\n",
    "# Abstract\n",
    "functions summarize the complex logic into single unit i:e the rest of the code doesnt need to know the internal part of the function. The functions allows to be organized logically.\n",
    "# Redability \n",
    "The fucntions make the code readable and easy to understand by providing the exact function names which gives meaning to the function ad operations they perform.\n",
    "# Debug \n",
    "When the functions is divided into smaller parts it is easy to identify the bugs by their names,which makes debugging more efficient and time saving,without changing the parameters of the whole code.\n",
    "# Efficiency \n",
    "Functions are optimized individually which makes the performance smooth and efficent, which are well defined and organized easy to update or change the specfic function as per the requirements.\n",
